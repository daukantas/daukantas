What I am seeing is that If I can show a demonstrable effort  to address  a particular area of  development ,
like A healthy water sector critical to economic growth and competitiveness.
By 2025, 800 million people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water ...you  will better understand my sense of  urgency and my path of inquiry .
My proposal will be  posted to a hyperlink or two that demonstrates  what  virtual reality projects   can render  to  areas  and regions and   that rely on safe ,
cost effective , funding for major  infrastructural ventures and AI capabilities .
For example :https://esastar-publication-ext.sso.esa.int/ESATenderActions/details/58183`

Case -in-Point : A solution to a major gap in MBTA,BART and other US transit systems seems to be overlooking Micro Soft Azure MVP  contributions :
A. The point here, is that safe,cost effective tech enabled platform can save  the lives of work crews and their contractors and  that the 'telemetry '
of an AI enabled Drone can provide an Owner or Project Engineer at a particular work site location the safety risks assessed by an AI equipped Drone.
