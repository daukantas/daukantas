I refer my AI apps  to a "Human Centered" approach by applying the HAX tool kit : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/
Iâ€™m interested in advancing AI web technologies and preparing AI Practioners for taking a "Hippocratic Oath" with a humane regard for human beings.

Brief Analysis (Trouble Shooting) Web Enabled Technology Platforms .
Narrative Description: 
What I am seeing is that If I can show a demonstrable effort  to address  a particular area of  development ,
like A healthy water sector critical to economic growth and competitiveness. 
By 2025, 800 million people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water ...you  will better understand my sense of  urgency and my path of inquiry .
My proposal will be  posted to a hyperlink or two that demonstrates  what  virtual reality projects   can render  to  areas  and regions and   that rely on safe , 
cost effective , funding for major  infrastructural ventures. 
For example :

 A scientist would ask where the regions and sectors  are that could benefit the global community are. Given access, once the hyperlink is viewable, beginning teacher or mentor can critique for technical analysis a credible source:

Case -in-Point : A solution to a major gap in MBTA,BART and other US transit systems seems to be overlooking Micro Soft Azure MVP  contributions :
A. The point here, is that safe,cost effective tech enabled platform can save  the lives of work crews and their contractors and  that the 'telemetry '
of an AI enabled Drone can provide an Owner or Project Engineer at a particular work site location the safety risks assessed by an AI equipped Drone.
Here, a Micro Soft Azure  (tool) au Neal McFee displays his project how to Rapidly equip a drone with AI using the Azure Percept 
How about embedding  AI models on a drone to do roof inspection? Check out how easy it can be to rapidly prototype an artificial intelligence vision model for use on a drone, without having to write any code!
